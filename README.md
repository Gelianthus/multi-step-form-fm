## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

### What I learned

I learned a lesson about how far back do you have to plan before even starting a project that involves multiple pages. It's a very different structure than what I was anticipating and had to redo a lot of things because of the lack of planning that went into this project.

### Continued development

Aside from the design aspect, I'm now aware of the importance of planning the structure of an application and will continue to develop the skill to properly construct applications that are user-friendly and efficient.

### Useful resources

- [react-router-dom](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - React Library - A library that offers client side routing. Although I didn't get to use it as it was a little bit too complex for me. I tried it out and immediately made everything easy. If I had implemented this library from the start, it would have save me lots of time. Unfortunately I decided to use other methods instead, but still saw the potential of this library.
